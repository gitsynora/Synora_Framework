# UltraNet Framework

**UltraNet** is a modular and intelligent backend framework based on .NET 8, designed with inspiration from Clean Architecture principles and modern development practices.

This project serves as a personal showcase of building reusable and scalable backend components for real-world applications.

## Features

- JWT Authentication system  
- In-Memory & Redis Caching  
- OTP (One-Time Password) module  
- Endpoint-based Rate Limiting  
- Structured Logging with flexibility  
- Organized, modular, and maintainable codebase

## Project Structure

The project follows a simplified and modular architecture, inspired by Clean Architecture, focused on maintainability and extensibility:

| Folder     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Core**   | Base contracts, interfaces, helpers, constants |
| **Modules**| Independent feature modules (Auth, Caching, Logging, OTP, Rate Limiting) |
| **Extensions** | Reusable extensions integrated into the Core |

> Each module is isolated, reusable, and easy to plug into other projects.
